# Example Shuffleboard 2019 Widgets

This repository contains the example FRC 2018 Shuffleboard widgets from my [VorTX 3735 Shuffleboard 2018 Widget examples](https://github.com/nleach999/Vortx3735.Shuffleboard.2018.WidgetTutorial "2018 Widget Repository") that have been ported to work with the FRC 2019 toolset.


The original examples used Maven under Eclipse.  These new examples build using Gradle under the FRC 2019 Visual Studio Code toolset.

Coding examples from the original videos still mostly apply except where noted:

### Video: [FRC Shuffleboard 2018 Widget Tutorial #1 from VorTX 3735 - Basic Widget Creation](https://youtu.be/suUSfivl3Og "Tutorial Video 1")

Skip chapters 1 & 2 about setting up the Maven project in Eclipse. Chapter 3 starts at 9:35.  You can add classes in Visual Studio Code
by adding files corresponding to your namespace in a directory tree under `src/main/java/`.


### Video: [FRC Shuffleboard 2018 Widget Tutorial #2 from VorTX 3735 - Simple Data Binding](https://youtu.be/Z8LCRqs8a9E "Tutorial Video 2")

The discussion at about 20:00 regarding using `AbstractWidget.exportProperties` to allow widget properties to appear in the "Properties" window no longer applies. 
The method `AbstractWidget.exportProperties` no longer exists in the 2019 API.  I have implemented an example of the replacement method in `MyMapBoundWidget.getSettings` and 
`MyDataBoundWidget.getSettings` that allows you to categorize properties into groups.

### Video: [FRC Shuffleboard 2018 Widget Tutorial #3 from VorTX 3735 - Map Data Binding](https://youtu.be/12kJ4ET6_x0 "Tutorial Video 3")
This is a bit more advanced data binding tutorial for binding grouped data values to a control.  Most of this video should still apply.


# HOW-TO: Use this as a template for your team's Shuffleboard Widget(s)

You can use this project as a quick start for your own Shuffleboard widget(s) by:

1. Forking a copy of this repository
2. Replace the source files under `src/main/java` and `src/test/java` with your own files.
3. Edit `settings.gradle` to make the library name of the jar that will contain your widgets.

I would encourage you to look at `gradle.build` to tune the dependencies to better fit the needs of your widget project.  Obviously everyone will not use the Han Solo gauge library, so that can be removed.

# HOW-TO: Build, Debug, and Deploy Your Widget(s)

## Building

You may still use the FRC 2019 VSCode IDE and build the code using the *WPILib Command Palette*.  Steps:

1. Click the *WPILib Command Palette* button in the top right corner or press CTRL-SHIFT-P.
2. Type *WPILib: Build Robot Code*

Why would we be building Robot code?  We aren't - this command simply invokes the `build` task set up by Gradle.


You may alternately use the *WPILib: Run a command in Gradle* command:

1. Click the *WPILib Command Palette* button in the top right corner or press CTRL-SHIFT-P.
2. Type `WPILib: Run a command in Gradle`
3. Type `build` to execute the build task

Building only builds the project.  It does not deploy the resulting jar where it can be picked up by Shuffleboard automatically.

## Deploying

Deploying will copy the jar to the `%USERPROFILE%/Shuffleboard/plugins` (Windows) or `~/Shuffleboard/plugins` (Linux/Mac) folder on the local machine.  Shuffleboard will automatically make widgets in your jar available for use when it starts. Deploying is similar to building:

1. Click the *WPILib Command Palette* button in the top right corner or press CTRL-SHIFT-P.
2. Type `WPILib: Run a command in Gradle`
3. Type `deployWidget` to execute the deployment

Running the `deployWidget` task will automatically invoke the `build` task.

## Debugging

Once the `deployWidget` Gradle task copies your jar for automatic loading by Shuffleboard, you can perform some debugging.

### Non-Interactive Debugging
Using Java API methods to output text to [STDOUT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams "Learn about standard streams") (i.e. `System.out.println()` or similar) will be captured in output log files.  Every time Shuffleboard runs, 
a log file may be found at `%USERPROFILE%/Shuffleboard` (Windows) or `~/Shuffleboard` (Linux/Mac).  

### Interactive Debugging
A tutorial about debugging in VSCode can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-debugging "Java Debuggin in VSCode") for those who are not familiar with interactive debugging.  I have included the file `.vscode/launch.json` that will automatically launch Shuffleboard when selecting **Debug->Start Debugging** (or **F5** as the keyboard shortcut).  You can then set breakpoints, inspect variables, and do all sorts of other things that make debugging this way superior to the old-school *log-to-stdout* method.


# Errors and Issues
During debugging, I noticed that some of the widget properties would cause the Shuffleboard to have an error when saving the layout.  I have not completely verified why
this happens as it did not appear to be an issue in the 2018 implementation.
